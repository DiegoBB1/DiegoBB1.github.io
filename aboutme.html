                                    I am a passionate software developer with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from The University of Texas at San Antonio, 
                                    graduating Summa Cum Laude in May 2024 with a 3.99 GPA. My journey in computer science began with a deep curiosity for how the technology around us 
                                    functions, especially in such a modern technology-dependent society, inspiring me to explore programming and problem-solving.
                                    Outside of computer science, I have a strong interest in criminal justice, which led me to take courses such as 
                                    Criminological Theory and Research Design and Analysis of Criminal Justice.

                                    Throughout my time at UTSA, I was named to the President's List seven times and the Dean's List once, in recognition of finishing semesters at the top of my class. Additionally, I was 
                                    actively involved in hackathons, such as UTSA's RowdyHacks, where I collaborated with other students to build projects and put my 
                                    programming skills to use.

                                    Some of the many courses that shaped my technical expertise include Analysis of Algorithms, Data Structures, Software 
                                    Engineering, and Web Technologies. Beyond my core computer science courses, I took additional classes in Game Development, 
                                    Cryptography, Cyber Operations, and Cybersecurity, expanding my knowledge and practical experience in various fields that I 
                                    found interest in.

                                    During my senior year at UTSA, I was employed as a teaching assistant for the UTSA Computer Science Department. Through this 
                                    position, I not only deepened my understanding of complex topics but also had the opportunity to guide other students in their 
                                    studies. This role enhanced my communication skills and my ability to help others understand complex algorithms. I also gained 
                                    valuable experience in conducting code reviews and optimizations, which strengthened my programming and analytical skills.
